### environment.py
Imports: Import necessary libraries and modules.
PlatformEnv Class: Define the custom environment.
Initialization: Set up the environment, including screen dimensions, action space, and observation space.
reset Method: Reset the environment by creating a new agent and generating platforms.
generate_platforms Method: Generate platforms starting from the bottom of the screen and expanding upwards. Ensure that the vertical distance between platforms is within the agent's jump height.
_get_state Method: Return the current
state of the environment as an array.
step Method: Update the environment based on the action taken by the agent. Apply gravity and check for boundary conditions.
render Method: Render the environment by drawing all sprites on the screen.
close Method: Close the environment and clean up resources.

### dqn_model.py
Imports: Import necessary libraries and modules.
DQN Class: Define the neural network for the DQN model.
Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the input image.
Fully Connected Layer: Output the Q-values for each action.

### train_dqn.py
Imports: Import necessary libraries and modules.
Transition Named Tuple: Define a named tuple to store transitions.
ReplayMemory Class: Implement the replay memory for storing transitions.
push Method: Add a transition to the memory.
sample Method: Sample a batch of transitions from the memory.
optimize_model Function: Implement the optimization step for the DQN algorithm.
State-Action Values: Compute the Q-values for the current state-action pairs.
Expected State-Action Values: Compute the expected Q-values for the next states.
Loss Calculation: Compute the loss between the state-action values and the expected state-action values.
Backpropagation: Update the model parameters using backpropagation.
Initialization: Initialize the environment and the DQN model.
select_action Function: Select an action based on the current state using an epsilon-greedy policy.
Epsilon-Greedy Policy: Balance exploration and exploitation by selecting a random action with probability epsilon and the best action with probability 1-epsilon.
Training Loop: Train the agent using the DQN algorithm.
Episodes: Run multiple episodes to train the agent.
State Transition: Update the state based on the action taken by the agent.
Memory Update: Store the transition in the replay memory.
Model Optimization: Optimize the model using the transitions stored in the replay memory.
Target Network Update: Update the target network periodically.
